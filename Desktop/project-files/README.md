heavenlyangels
A fictional portfolio-style website meant to display a photographer's work in order to hypothetically build the business and obtain more clients. This website was created as a class project for a Front End Web Development course. Heavenly Angels is not a real business and Lindsey Grace is not a real person. All information on this website is completely fictional including, but not limited to, the phone number, the email address, the business address, both social media profiles, and all copyright displays. All images were obtained, free of charge and without any licence, from pexels.com. The purpose of this website is solely to display some of the skills that I learned during a 12 week course. I had no prior knowledge or experience before beginning this course. This project is not 100% complete and it will likely be a work in process for a long time to come. The inspiration behind my design was easy: This is my very first website that I have ever designed or developed so it is my baby(hence the theme) and the educational opportunities that I am receiving through Code Louisville has been a true God send, explaining the name.
